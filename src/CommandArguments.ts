// TODO: Write class that takes ParserOutput and a command argument spec and assembles usable runtime arguments.
//
//       - Parsed arguments that do not match a defined spec can be discarded.
//
//       - Kept arguments should have their values run through resolvers to resolve their runtime
//         type based on the type declared in the spec for that argument.
//
//       - Valid (defined) option types should have their occurrences summed.
